The `intMEMOIR_mcc_files.zip` file was acquired from Sophie Seidel, and includes the MCC ([maximum clade credibility](https://beast.community/summarizing_trees)) trees from running TiDeTree (jointly on all samples, as described in the [paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2022.1844)). We used TreeAnnotator to produce the MCC tree (saved in 106 files labeled `*.mcc.newick`) containing branch lengths.
