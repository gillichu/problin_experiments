The `intMEMOIR_mcc_files.zip` file was acquired from Sophie Seidel, and includes the MCC ([maximum clade credibility](https://beast.community/summarizing_trees)) trees from running TiDeTree (jointly on all samples, as described in the [paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2022.1844)). We used TreeAnnotator (v2.6.0) to produce the MCC tree (saved in 106 files labeled `*.mcc.newick`) containing branch lengths. 

We also include the input data (character matrices and prior file, as well as the ground truth tree), as well as the Startle-NNI tree, Cassiopeia-Hybrid trees, and the sc-MAIL trees (named `EM_problin.txt`). Some of the Startle-NNI trees are missing -- this happens when Startle cannot find a more parsimonious tree than the input tree. The Cassiopeia-Hybrid trees were used as starting trees, so these can effectively be used as the Startle-NNI input trees. 

Note that we tried using both Cassiopeia-Hybrid trees and Startle-NNI trees as starting trees for sc-MAIL, but found slightly better topology accuracy results when using Startle-NNI, so we only include (and report) results from this experiment.
