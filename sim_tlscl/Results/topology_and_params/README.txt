Providing scripts and results file for benchmarking on the simulated TLSCL dataset. Cassiopeia-ILP only finished on 44/250 samples (h0d100: 13, h100d0: 8, h25d75: 15, h50d50: 4, h75d25: 4). Of the ones that errored, 100 did not finish running given 168 hours of runtime, 48 jobs ran out of memory (given 4G per job), 26 finished with a GurobiError, and 32 finished with an IndexError from within the Cassiopeia code.
